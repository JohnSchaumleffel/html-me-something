      <h2>Professional Career</h2>
        <div>
          I started working when I was 17 at a drycleaner. I worked there through college and trade school until I found a job as a mechanic. I have been working as a mechanic professionally for 6 years. I have worked for dealers and small operations. I am currently the shop manager of a small shop in St. Charles, MO.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <div>
          I enjoy doing all sorts of things with my family and friends. I just recently started to play golf. What began as a one off for a friends bachelor party has turned into a bit of an obsession. I really enjoy the game. I have also just started to play Dungeons and Dragons. That has been a lot of fun as well. There are seven of us total including the DM and we gather every Sunday for a few hours to play. If you have ever thought about playing I highly recommend it.

        <h2>Future</h2>
          <div>
            I am hoping that upon completion of the Launchcode program that I will find a job with a nice company doing something programming related. I am not sure what I like most about programming just yet. Python was alright. HTML is not that hard but there is a lot of material to learn. I have a friend that is currently employed as a software developer in Java. I think it would be great if I could find a career in Java as well.
