            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is John Schaumleffel. I am 30 years old and currently work as a mechanic. I am married and have a daughter named Sophia. I enjoy all sorts of activities but I am going to focus on the the three that I do the most. Games, golf, and fixing things.</p>

          <h2>Games</h2>
          <img src="images/featured-dnd-holiday.png"/>
          <p>My favorite game to play currently is Dungeons and Dragons. It is a table top role playing game where you assume the identity of some sort of hero, my character is a rogue, and you go on quests with frineds. I have only been playing for about a month but I really enjoy it. It is the most fun you can have while sitting at a table.</p>

          <h2>Golf</h2>
          <img src="images/Golfbackground.jpg"/> 
          <p>I just recently started to play golf. What began as a one off for a friends bachelor party has turned into a bit of an obsession. I try to go the range at least once a week to practice and weather permitting I try to play at least 9 holes of actual golf once a month. </p>

            <h2>Fixing Things</h2>
            <img src="images/woodworking.jpeg"/>
            <p>I have always liked working with my hands. Whether it be on a vehicle, computer or a piece of furniture. I currently in the process of drawing up plans for a large table that my friends and I can play D&D on. I would also like to try my hand at blacksmithing but my garage is a little too messy to install a forge right now.</p>
